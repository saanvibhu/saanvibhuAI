1.        What two academic accomplishments are you most proud of and why?
* Accomplishment 1: It was hard to adjust to high school. I was so overwhelmed with the new school and clubs I was joining. The first week, I had a few quizzes for math and I ended up failing them. I was confused because I had never been failing in a class before. These timed quizzes were difficult because I would be distracted with the other tasks I had for the rest of the day. I felt defeated because I believed if I did not know how to do algebra, I could not perform complex high school math in the future. Everyday, I came home from school and studied what I learned in math. I really learned how to focus. My grades on these timed quizzes went from 40s to 100s. I ended up with an A on the unit test. This experience taught me that hard work can always make a situation better, and I carried this on throughout my high school career. I am proud and grateful that I persevered through this because math eventually became my favorite subject. 
During my sophomore year, there were timed quizzes again. I was able to learn from my mistakes the year before and do very well this year. I practiced under pressure and was able to finish the quizzes with ease. 


* Accomplishment 2: I built a Rube Goldberg machine for my AP Physics class competition. I probably spent two hours every day for a couple weeks on this project. I rarely have fun when working on school projects, but this one brightened my day and was a break from other homework. I realized that every part of the machine had to be perfect, or else it would not work. By planning ahead and thinking creatively, I made a pulley out of a ribbon holder and some string. 


*  For the class vote, I won second place in my class for the best machine and video. I felt proud because I love building things and it was nice to see that people agreed I was good at it. 
This project taught me that hard work pays off and it taught me that you must have patience when working on this type of machine. 


2.        What two or three personal accomplishments are you most proud of and why?


* Accomplishment 1: I am proud of winning 1st in State for the TSA Biotechnology Design competition in 2021. It feels surreal to know that a project I put a considerable amount of effort into ended up winning a state level prize. Sitting in my room everyday wondering: what could I do to make this project even better? Our team worked together well, offering new findings every day. We’d sit on Microsoft Teams brainstorming new ideas for our project. I remember we were not sure if we’d even place because of how unique our idea was. I remember we were filming our presentation and trying to say “Clostridium Novyi-NT bacteria” without pausing. We did it eventually. Reading study after study, I had come up with real-life applications for using bacteria and competitive exclusion to combat antibiotic resistance, eventually placing my team and I first at State. 


* Accomplishment 2: I was sitting in VOX Chorus rehearsal after school and chatting with the soprano section when our choral director yelled “Solo Auditions today!”. We had been working on a German piece for LGPE and it was tough, to say the least. The solo was in German so we had to learn the correct pronunciation. The notes were very high, perfect for us sopranos. I had never gotten a solo before, as it was occasional for a choral piece to have one. In addition, LGPE was the most important performance of the year, because credible judges would score our performance and other high schools performances. LGPE for the musical department is like State Championships for the athletic department. And so, auditions began after we had warmed up. We went in a line and I went first. Whenever I sing in front of people, I am immersed in just the music and I forget about everything else. Still in shock from hitting all the notes correctly, I was confused when people cheered for me. After everyone had gone, the choral director announced I had gotten the solo. The VOX chorus is the highest group in our school and I had a solo with them. I was so surprised, but happy. My first solo for Cambridge Chorus would be musically complex, in German, and in front of attentive judges. 
Singing on a stage in front of people is both thrilling and terrifying, yet I choose to do it again and again, I thought when the pianist began playing the German piece, Zigeunerleben. We were very prepared since our group had practiced in and out of class. Once the piano started playing that oh so familiar intro to my solo, I shut out all distractions and just sang my piece. After all, I knew that solo backwards. Every bit of it was exhilarating. Once it was over, we all continued spitting out German. I was proud of us for nailing that piece, and proud of myself for doing the solo correctly and beautifully. I had so many compliments that day, because it was the first time many people had seen me sing. In their minds, the random freshman who got to be in Mastery the first time she auditioned became the talented sophomore who was in two choirs because she deserved to.


3.        Of all the classes you have taken in high school, which one(s) have you enjoyed most and why?


My favorite class was Precalculus. I loved the challenging ‘outside-the-box’ problems that would make me think for a while. These would be problems based on what we already learned, but our teacher did not exactly walk us through how to do the whole problem. It was fun to take what I had learned and apply it in a certain way to solve these challenging problems. Math gives me the power to solve problems that I used to think I could not solve. With math, I’ve developed skills such as sequence and pattern recognition, problem solving, and systematic thinking. I can apply these skills to other aspects of my life and use them to improve upon myself. Whatever career or job I choose in the future, I know that my knowledge of math will always help me. 




4.        If you have selected a college major, what major and why?




        My college major would be related to Computer Science and Engineering. As a devoted                 student to math and science, I believe Engineering and CS would prove to be challenging                 and I like to challenge myself so I do not get bored. I have also enjoyed using logical                         reasoning as a tool to solve problems related to engineering and computer science. 




5.        Discuss a time you showed leadership in any way (i.e. Have you started something or enriched something?) (there is a leadership essay for Apply Texas so write that essay out here) 250 words




For my Girl Scout Gold Award, I have shown leadership by directing my team with tasks. The goal of my Gold Award project was to improve education in an Indian village through a book drive, website, and seminar. I have asked people for input and gone out of my comfort zone to further my goal. I asked people in my community to donate books and support the cause by sharing the project with their friends. I collected over 70 books and donated them all to the school in Zaladanki. I made a website and directed a seminar hoping to educate 100+ students in this village. This was the first big volunteer project I worked on as the lead.  


6.        Tell me about a time you persisted in getting something done even though it was difficult.
        
AP Physics I was one of the toughest classes I have ever taken. For one of our group projects, we were instructed to build a roller coaster that was at least 1 meter tall, made out of paper in three days. I have never consistently worked on a project in my life. For two days, I would eat, sleep, and work on the paper roller coaster. I knew I could give up and let another group member do it for me, but I was determined to get it done because I knew they were depending on me to start the other part of the project. I wanted to prove that I was capable of building the rollercoaster. An issue encountered was the paper falling down so I had to build paper support columns to help the rollercoaster stay in place. One of the required additions to the coaster was a full vertical loop and it was difficult to get the marble to go fast enough to not fall off the loop. Eventually, with trial and error, I was able to get the marble at the right speed to go through the loop perfectly. 


7.        What makes you stand out among your peers?  (In other words: If I were going to describe you in a few sentences to someone who has never met you, then what would I say?)
        
I am constantly recommending new music to my peers. I edit fun meme videos to make my friends laugh. I am brutally honest, a good listener, and determined. I put my whole heart into whatever I do, meaning I never cast an activity or project aside while I am still involved in it. I am a realist and usually think things through. With group projects, I work collaboratively and offer input and ideas when the assignment is not straightforward. I make sure my sleep schedule stays consistent even if I am busy during the entire day. 




Why are you seeking a recommendation from me?
* French:
   * I have been able to show how I work in groups and take responsibility because of my overall involvement in French Honor Society (meetings, fundraisers, and drives, etc.)


What impact did my class have you you?


* French 3 Honors was a fun, interesting, and preparatory class. I loved learning about French culture and the different verb tenses. Our group projects were also fun. I remember the one where we had to create a story on a poster and present it.
