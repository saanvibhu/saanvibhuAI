Dear Hiring Manager,


As a software developer and musician, I want to blend technical skills with creative talent through a QA internship at Dolby. My foundation is meticulous attention to detail, continuously improving piano parts and code until they sound perfect.


From a young age immersed in music, I developed an ear for subtle details while doing piano recitals and plays. This built sharp analytical skills and nonstop dedication to my work, allowing me to spot complexities in songs and code. During long nights debugging programs, memories of pushing through musical frustrations keep me persevering.


Additionally, an internship at a trending social media startup expanded my creative problem-solving. By substantially contributing to product development, I gained broad exposure to agile teams, user-friendly design, and delivering innovative solutions quickly. While prizing thorough preparation, I also learned to bring an adventurous mindset when brainstorming - trying unexpected chord changes or debugging tactics. This gave me the confidence to improvise new methods.


I’m thrilled to synthesize this sonic background into important engineering contributions at Dolby. With expertise in enhancing entertainment through technology, Dolby’s mission strongly connects with my twin passions for music and programming. I aim to harmonize my unique perspective, both artistic and analytical, into innovations.


During Summer 2021, I interned at an international technology company, where I worked on various projects related to music technology, and social media. This opportunity allowed me to apply my theoretical knowledge in a real-world setting, further honing my problem-solving abilities and attention to detail. I learned how to work with a professional team on Slack, attend Scrum meetings, and not be afraid to speak to those in higher-level positions within the company.


In summary, my diverse artistic and technical experiences equip me to thrive as an intern. I welcome the chance to showcase how this one-of-a-kind blend of skills can lift Dolby’s innovations higher. Thank you for your consideration.
