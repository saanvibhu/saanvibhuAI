              "Document(metadata={'source': 'full_data/3040PaperSaanviBhumpalle.txt'}, page_content='Deep learning in computer vision provides many levels of abstraction that mimic the deep neural networks in our brains. Deep neural networks in our brains are extremely “complex” and still not completely understood (Kriegeskorte, 2015). By contrast, computational models have artificial neural networks that have well-defined layers with matrix multiplication, stochastic pooling, convolution, and other mathematical operations. Humans are better at context and understanding the meaning behind a visual scene, unlike computers. Perhaps artificial neural networks can incorporate layers for deriving information from the context of a scene through semantical analysis. Humans all have different biases when gathering the gist from a visual scene. Still, computer vision would gather unbiased input that computer scientists would achieve by cleaning data sets and removing bias from those (Kyle-Davidson et al., 2023).\\n        \\nBecause human attention is split, they fully process one thing at a time, requiring the division of their attention between two tasks. This results in attention limitations such as inattentional blindness and change blindness which leads to missing things right in front of our eyes. The objects humans do attend to can be more accurate than most computer vision models currently, while computer vision models can easily multitask for attention in the context of object recognition. Since humans cannot multitask, selective attention is used to shift attention to the most important content in the scene. However, computers cannot multitask with every single object in a scene as they experience “computational complexity” as well. (Frintrop et al., 2010). Computer scientists can account for the lack of resources by prioritizing a few inputs from the visual scene at a time.\\n\\n\\nAlthough computer vision can maximize the strengths of human vision while ignoring its weaknesses, human vision currently proves to be more accurate due to its intricate capabilities. Scientists still need to understand the layers behind neural networks in our brains. Computer scientists can replicate human vision upon iteration of these computational vision models to produce fewer instances of misrepresented feature, object and image classification.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReferences\\nUllman, S., Assif, L., Fetaya, E., & Harari, D.
